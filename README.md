Text-to-speech (TTS) technology allows users to have written text spoken out loud by a computer or device. TTS can be useful in a variety of situations, such as for people with visual impairments who rely on audio output to access written content, for language learners who want to hear proper pronunciation of words and phrases, or for people who want to listen to written content while doing other tasks. There are many text-to-speech programs and applications available, ranging from free to paid options, and some devices, such as smartphones and smart speakers, come with built-in TTS capabilities. TTS technology works by using algorithms and pre-recorded audio samples to convert written text into spoken words. It is important to note that the quality of TTS can vary greatly depending on the specific program or device being used.

Google Cloud Text-to-Speech enables developers to synthesize natural-sounding speech with 100+ voices, available in multiple languages and variants. It applies DeepMind’s groundbreaking research in WaveNet and Google’s powerful neural networks to deliver the highest fidelity possible. As an easy-to-use API, you can create lifelike interactions with your users, across many applications and devices.
